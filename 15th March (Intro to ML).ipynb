    "Q1 . a) Artificial Intelligence (AI): Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. AI involves the development of intelligent systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as speech recognition, problem-solving, decision-making, and understanding natural language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: One example of artificial intelligence is a virtual personal assistant like Siri or Google Assistant. These assistants use natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to understand and respond to user queries, perform tasks, and provide relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Machine Learning: Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It involves the construction of mathematical models and algorithms that allow systems to learn from and make predictions or take actions based on data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: An example of machine learning is spam email filtering. Machine learning algorithms can be trained on a dataset of labeled emails (spam or not spam) to learn patterns and characteristics of spam emails. Once trained, the algorithm can accurately classify incoming emails as spam or not spam based on its learned knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Deep Learning: Deep Learning is a subfield of Machine Learning that focuses on artificial neural networks with multiple layers, also known as deep neural networks. Deep Learning aims to simulate the functioning of the human brain's neural networks to learn and make intelligent decisions. It is particularly effective for processing and understanding complex data such as images, audio, and text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: An example of deep learning is image recognition. Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can be trained on large datasets of labeled images to learn patterns and features in images. Once trained, these models can accurately classify or identify objects, people, or scenes in new images with high accuracy."
